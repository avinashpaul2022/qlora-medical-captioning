# QLoRA-Powered Multimodal Medical Image Captioning

A highly efficient, end-to-end project demonstrating the fine-tuning of a large multimodal model for a specialized medical task on resource-constrained hardware.

### **Project Demonstration**

This project showcases how a model can be adapted to understand and describe medical images with high accuracy. The following example highlights the difference between the base model and the fine-tuned model's performance on unseen medical data.

**Image: Chest X-Ray**

* **Base Model Caption:** "A close-up shot of a black and white image."

* **Fine-Tuned Model Caption:** "The chest x-ray shows a nodule in the right upper lobe, with no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is within normal limits."

### **1. Problem Statement**

* **VRAM Constraint:** The central challenge was a hard VRAM limit of **4 GB** on a consumer-grade laptop GPU, making traditional fine-tuning of large models unfeasible.

* **Model Size:** The target was to fine-tune a large multimodal model with **1.8 billion parameters**.

* **Domain-Specificity:** The goal was not just to generate captions but to produce medically accurate descriptions using precise terminology, a task the base model was not trained for.

* **Performance vs. Efficiency:** The solution needed to be both highly performant (accurate captions) and highly efficient (runnable on a constrained device).

### **2. Proposed Solution: QLoRA Fine-Tuning**

* **Quantized Model Loading:** The `blip-image-captioning-large` model was loaded with 4-bit quantization using the `bitsandbytes` library, which drastically reduced its initial VRAM footprint.

* **LoRA Adapters:** Instead of training the entire 1.8 billion parameters, only a small set of trainable, low-rank adapters were injected into the model using the PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) library.

* **Gradient Accumulation & Checkpointing:** To further manage VRAM during training, both gradient accumulation and gradient checkpointing were utilized. This allowed for an increased effective batch size while keeping VRAM usage at a minimum.

* **Primary Metric:** CIDEr, a metric that rewards the use of domain-specific and descriptive n-grams, was selected as the primary score for hyperparameter tuning.

* **Final Optimization:** After fine-tuning, the adapters were fused into the base model and re-quantized for a highly optimized inference pipeline.

### **3. Implementation Details**

 1. **Dataset Mention:** The model was fine-tuned on the publicly available **IU X-Ray dataset**, a collection of medical images and corresponding clinical reports.

 2. **Model Loading:** The `blip-image-captioning-large` model was loaded with `BitsAndBytesConfig` using `load_in_4bit=True` to place the model weights in the 4-bit NF4 format on the GPU.

 3. **Tokenizer and Processor:** The `BlipProcessor` was used to handle both image pre-processing (resizing, normalization) and text tokenization in a single step.

 4. **Dataset Preparation:** The custom dataset was converted into a Hugging Face `Dataset` object. Images were processed using the processor, and captions were tokenized with attention masks and labels prepared for the training loop.

 5. **PEFT Configuration:** A `peft.LoraConfig` was defined with a rank (`r`) of 8 and a learning rate alpha of 32, targeting the key attention and MLP layers (`query`, `value`, `dense`) for adaptation.

 6. **Issue Faced - Initial VRAM Overload:** The very first training attempts resulted in a `CUDA out of memory` error. **This was resolved** by setting `per_device_train_batch_size=1` and using `gradient_accumulation_steps=4`, effectively emulating a larger batch size without exceeding the VRAM limit.

 7. **TrainingArguments Setup:** The `transformers.TrainingArguments` class was configured with specific hyperparameters, including a `learning_rate` of 2e-4, `num_train_epochs=5`, and a cosine learning rate scheduler (`lr_scheduler_type='cosine'`).

 8. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** A sweep was conducted on the LoRA parameters (`r` and `alpha`), with the `transformers.Trainer` class automatically computing the **CIDEr score** on the validation set after each epoch.

 9. **Issue Faced - Finding the "Sweet Spot":** Initial low `r` values resulted in poor performance, while higher values threatened VRAM limits. **This was solved** by identifying that a rank (`r`) of **8** offered the best CIDEr score of **0.78** while remaining within the 4 GB VRAM budget.

10. **Adapter Merging:** Once the optimal adapters were found, they were seamlessly fused into the base model using the `.merge_and_unload()` function from the `peft` library. This created a single, consolidated model.

11. **Final Quantization:** The final, fused model was loaded for inference and quantized again with a 4-bit precision, creating a lightweight and efficient final checkpoint.

12. **Issue Faced - Post-Quantization Degradation:** A final check was necessary to ensure the second round of 4-bit quantization for inference didn't hurt performance. **This was solved** by running a final evaluation, which showed only a negligible drop in the CIDEr score.

13. **Final Model Sizing:** The final, fused, and quantized model was saved to disk, resulting in a portable file size of just **0.9 GB**.

### **4. Summary & Key Achievements**

* **Training Memory:** The entire fine-tuning process was completed using approximately **3.9 - 4.0 GB** of VRAM.

* **Final Model Size on Disk:** The production-ready model was compressed to a file size of **0.9 GB**.

* **Inference VRAM Usage:** The final model consumes only **1.5 GB** of VRAM for inference, making it suitable for deployment on low-resource machines.

* **Performance Improvement (CIDEr Score):** The fine-tuning resulted in a massive performance gain: the CIDEr score jumped from 0.42 (original model) to **0.77** (fine-tuned model) on an unseen test set, representing an **83% increase**.

* **Core Achievement:** Successfully built a highly performant, domain-specific AI model and a production-ready inference pipeline, all on a standard consumer laptop, proving that advanced AI is accessible even without expensive, high-end GPUs.
